# UK Bike packing maps

Firstly, these maps and data are for you to use at your own risk. I take no responsibility for the accuracy of the maps or the data contained within.

These maps are meant for bikepackers within the UK, they have been created using free Ordnance Survey Open Data (Vector District), Openstreetmap tracks and water tap data, Food standards eatery location data, bothy locations kindly supplied by Matthew Cockerham and supermarket locations from an open data set supplied by Geolytix ltd.

The maps contain the following features:-

-UK roads, buildings, woods etc... using OS data
-UK paths/bridleways/byways using OSM data
-contour lines
-bothies (thanks Chew!!)
-taps (from OSM, not a brilliant data set at the moment)
-supermarkets
-"eating places"
-a lot of the NCN network

The POIs are all searchable so on the GPS you can look for the nearest bothy. I've not tested this in the field yet.

I have also burnt in the following ITT routes

-HTR550
-Cairngorm loop
-Borders 350
-Lakeland 200
-Penine Bridleway
-SDW
-Trans Cambrian Way
-Ridgeway
-Kielder and Cheviot
-EWE

A sample can be seen at the url here http://phased.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/bikepack.png

At the moment they are very much beta copies, please raise any issues you find here and I will do my best to create a set of new releases that improve them over time.



The maps are in no way perfect.
